# Alien Invasion

DISCLAIMER: This project is under construction, not a fully working solution. It is updated daily. 
Estimated completion time: 1.5 months

## Motivation
This is one of my self-learning projects. I am building it to practice my theoretical knowledge of Object Oriented Programming in Python.

DISCLAIMER(2): In order to learn the best Python practices, I am using the book *Python Crash Course - A hands-on, Project-based introduction to programming*.
The *alien invasion* is one of the book's projects. In order to learn as much as possible, I am reading the non-code text and translating it to code on my own,
as I believe it should be. Only then I peek at the book's solution and check what I did wrong, correct it, make notes and move on. 
Hence, I am **not** the inventor of the coding solution that lives in this repository. That being said, due to the way 
I have been working with the book, I am confident I can rewrite the game without the help of the book, which is the whole point of this project.

## Specifications
Alien Invasion is an old and quite famous arcade game. It is best known as *Space Invaders*. More can be found [here][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders]
The specifications are simply to build this game usint the *Pygame* gaming library.

## Project Milestones

[x] Create a gaming environment (screen) with Pygame
[x] Import image of spaceship and make it move on keyboard key presses
[x] Update constantly the screen with the new position of its components (ship, aliens etc)
[ ] Import images of aliens and make them move without autonomously
[ ] Create bullet-firing functionality and collision logic
[ ] Keep track of score and end of game if player loses
[ ] Knit up any edge cases (eg. edge of screen)
[ ] Test thoroughly and play a lot!
